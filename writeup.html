               We first use the intersect plane method to compute a collision with a plane that lies parallel to the triangle we're testing.
               To do so, you need to calculate the normal of the triangle, which you can do by computing hte cross product of two of its edges
               (to get the normal) and then working out how far away from the origin it lies. If the plane intersection test passes, We work out the
               barycentric coordinates of the intersection point and make sure it's inside the triangle.

            <p>
                To solve the sphere intersection we utilized the quadratic formula to compute the location a ray
                intersected with the collision object. We accomplished this by constructing each of the variables for
                the quadratic and solving for the positive determinant case. This gave us two options to pick from since the quadratic
                formula can give multiple solutions. We always chose the closest option (ignoring a negative value for our parameter). The normal is parallel
                to the intersection point - the center of the sphere.

                <hr>
            <p>
                For this we partitioned the space of hittable regions into each of the planes that make up the box and
                computed intersections for each of the options, returning the closest of any positive hits.

            <p>
                The same approach as with the sphere, we craft a similar quadratic equation and solve for the two values for the tube part of the cylinder.
                We then make sure that the ray doesn't go too high or too low. The normal is given by P - Pc where P is the intercet point and 
                Pc is the closest point to the center of the tube's axis. Then we do another test for the disks (plain and then, inside-circle test) and pick the nearest of the intersections.

                Usual quadratic approach for the main cone, but the cutoff is slightly different to the cyllinder since the equation solves for a double infinite cone.
                The normal is calculated by working out a projection of the center of the base onto the side. We also reuse the disk intersection for the base.
                Finally we return the closest positive result.

                Hard shadows involved comparing the ray-light vector to the interaction vector. Since we shoot a ray
                from the light to the object, we check first for any collision in the scene. Then, from there, we get an
                additional check to determine if the scene intersection and the position that should be in the shadow
                hit the same thing. If they did, we know that the object is not in a shadow. However, if the difference
                between the two values is greater than zero (or eps in this case), we knew that they probably hit at
                different locations and, thus, there was likely a shadow.

                Since refractive behavior is a function of the indicent vector and the refraction direction, we just
                needed to re-form snells law in a way that allowed us to relate the angles between these two quantities.
                The easiest way to compute the relations between the vectors was by using dot products. In this case, we
                just compared the source normal to the indicent vector and with the eta term we could apply snells law
                directly.

                To make the checkerboard pattern we needed to mimic the sinusoid periodicity that a checkerboard has. To
                do this, we scaled the intersection position into a flat range, and removed the intermediate states like
                you might find in a sine, and transformed the whole thing into basically a step function by using the
                floor operation. We added a real-valued scaling term which can adjust the size of the checkerboard tiles
                as well. To determine which color a tile got, we just checked if the value was even or odd, and this
                seemed to work well. To make sure it matched the sample photos, we just scaled the color instead of
                setting it black and white.

                Inside of a phong material our component was calculating the specular term for the surface of the
                object. We computed the direction of specular reflection by just using the built-in glsl function. This
                gave us the normalized reflection direction that the light would bounce back. Since specularity shows up
                as bright highlights, we needed to then get the specular term, which is just a scaled dot product of the
                view and reflection directions, raised to the power of the material shininess. This gives a large
                scaling to whatever light is provided, ensuring that it shows highlights correctly on the surface of the
                material.
